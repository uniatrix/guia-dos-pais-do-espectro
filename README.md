#Guia para pais do Espectro

Welcome to the "Guia para pais do Espectro", a React-based website in brazilian portuguese aimed at providing valuable resources and guidance for parents of children on the autism spectrum.

About
This website serves as a comprehensive resource hub for parents, caregivers, and anyone involved in the journey of supporting children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our goal is to offer a wealth of knowledge, curated by experts and informed by real-life experiences, to empower parents and caregivers in their roles.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This  uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
